    <h3>Basic:</h3>
    <ul>git config --global user.name Artem</ul>
    <ul>git config --global user.email artemijklymenko@gmail.com</ul>
    <ul>git init - creates a new Git repository.</ul>
    <ul>git status - displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.</ul>
    <ul>git add - adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.</ul>
    <ul>git commit - save your changes to the local repository.</ul>
    <ul>git log - shows a running record of commits.</ul>
    <ul>git checkout - navigate between the branches created by git branch.</ul>
    <ul>git branch - create, list, rename and delete branches.</ul>
    <ul>git push -  command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.</ul>
    <ul>git pull - update the local version of a repository from a remote.</ul>
    <ul>git merge - take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.</ul>
    <ul>git clone - target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.</ul>
    <ul>.gitignore - tells git which files (or patterns) it should ignore.</ul>
    <h3>Advanced:</h3>
    <ul>git revert - forward-moving undo operation that offers a safe method of undoing changes. Instead of deleting or orphaning commits in the commit history, a revert will create a new commit that inverses the changes specified.</ul>
    <ul>git reset - used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo/undo changes in your working directory that haven't been comitted yet.</ul>
    <ul>git rebase - (another way of "merge")integrate changes from one branch onto another.</ul>
    <ul>git cherry-pick - choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another.</ul>
    <ul>git stash - temporarily store your uncommitted local changes - and leave you with a clean working copy, to work on something else and come back later.</ul>
